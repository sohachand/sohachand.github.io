            <p>   

                Hi, I am Soha Chand! I am deeply passionate about technology and how it shapes the world around us. Whether it is exploring new advancements, building innovative projects, or solving technical challenges, I’m always eager to dive deeper into the ever-evolving tech landscape.  
                
                I thrive on learning and applying my skills to create solutions that make a difference. From coding to experimenting with new tools, I’m constantly expanding my knowledge and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve.  
                
                Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring ideas, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and staying curious about the endless possibilities the digital world offers.  
                
                Thank you for stopping by—I would love to connect and share ideas!  </p>
